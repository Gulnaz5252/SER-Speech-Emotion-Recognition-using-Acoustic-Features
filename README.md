# SER-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-Acoustic-Features
This project focuses on recognizing three emotions (angry, sad, neutral) from speech using machine learning techniques. By analyzing acoustic features such as pitch, Chroma, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR), we developed models to classify emotions conveyed through verbal speech.
